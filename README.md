# Winter and Restricted Boltzmann Machines
This repo is intended to be an experiment with restricted Boltzmann machines. Refer to [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/5859a108417621e64d7df371)
for real time progress updates and explanations of the math behind the model. The plan is as follows:

1. Write a restricted Boltzmann machine :checkered_flag:

1. Train model on data from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) :checkered_flag:

1. Tune model until it's clear that learned features of MNIST dataset aptly represent the image data

## Tentative plans

1. Build SVM that classifies MNIST dataset based on features learned by RBM

1. Build an alternative version of the RBM that is descriminative as opposed to generative

1. Try to use RBM to classify Alzheimer's patients from [this data](https://www.kaggle.com/jesseab/alzheimers-mri-deep-learning)
