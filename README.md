# Winter and Restricted Boltzmann Machines
This repo is intended to be an experiment with restricted Boltzmann machines. Refer to [THIS BLOG](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/5859a108417621e64d7df371)
for real time progress updates and explanations of the math behind the model. The plan is as follows:

1. Write a restricted Boltzmann machine :checkered_flag:

1. Train model on data from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) :checkered_flag:

1. Tune model until it's clear that learned features of MNIST dataset aptly represent the image data :checkered_flag:

1. Check to see if alternate representation learned by RBM is more useful than raw image data

## Tentative plans

1. Use SVM to classify MNIST dataset based on features learned by RBM :checkered_flag:

1. Try to use RBM to classify Alzheimer's patients from [this data](https://www.kaggle.com/jesseab/alzheimers-mri-deep-learning)
